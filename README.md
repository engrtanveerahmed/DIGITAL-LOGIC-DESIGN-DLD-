# Digital Stop Watch 

## Introduction
 
Stop is time measuring devices, which measure time between two intervals for this a stop watch must include a start button and reset button in order to stop the at desired point and restart for again start from initial point. 

## Component list
- **555 timer ic** 
- **Common cathode 7-segment display** 
- **Resistor (150 ohm, 100k ohm, 56k ohm)**
- **Capacitor (10 uf)**
- **On/off switch**

## Working principle of the project

A stop watch watch circuit basically work like a counter circuit, when we provide power supply it start counting from initial and we can stop it on desired point with help of button 
A digital stopwatch circuit having   two IC namely NE555 and  CD4033  and few more component. CD4033 is a Johnson counter IC commonly used in digital display. It contain 5 stage Johnson decade counter including  decoder which convert the Johnson code to a 7 segment decoded output. Means it will convert the input into numeric display which can be seen on 7 segment display which is the basic work of decoder.
The main working is of start and restart button which differentiate it from counter and make it digital counter.
A key point is to maintain frequency this is controlled by adding resistor and capacitor.
